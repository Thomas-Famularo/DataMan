-- 8: Check constraints are rules that you implement in SQL to prevent you from inputting certain values.  
-- They let you impose certain rules for a column or table as a whole. These rules keep data uniform and 
-- help keep a high quality of data.  A couple of good use of check constraints are making sure an input
-- is not over the maximum length, checking another table to make sure a customer exists, and making sure
-- a column is not null if it is going to be used for a primary key.  A poor use of check constrains 
-- would be requiring a user to input dashes when entering a phone number, also requiring an email 
-- address to be from a certain domain.  These good uses keep the quality of data high, the first is good
-- for keeping the speed of the system high, if you have a 1 trillion character long password it would
-- take a really long time for that person to log in.  The second is good for not placing an order for
-- a customer that does not exist. In general, you only want to be able to place orders for customers
-- that exist. The third is good for keeping your primary key a super key, it keeps duplicate data out
-- of your primary key which would cause major problems.  The first bad check constraint forces the user
-- to input data in a certain format that does not always make sense to the user.  The second bad check
-- constraint because emails can be associated with any domain not just the one you decide is correct.
